# KinesisBLE with Kinesis Professional/Advantage compatible PCB



These are KiCad files for the KinesisBLE PCB.  The PCB has been made slightly smaller from mikewudev's original design while still maintaining the same connector locations. There is also the option of using the PCB in a Kinesis Professional (with the flex PCB "fingers") by using Molex 39-53-2134 on J2 and J7.  For Kinesis Advantage a Molex 39-53-2135 or Cvilux CF01-13-1V00 is used on J5 and J6.

A couple issues with the layout:
1) the slots for the tabs need to extend 1mm closer to the center of the board.
2) the jumper for the power button led may interfer with the usb plug.

The board has been tested and is currently in use using ZMK firmware.
