# KinesisBLE with Kinesis Professional compatible PCB



These are KiCad files for the KinesisBLE PCB.  The PCB has been made slightly smaller while still maintaining the same connector locations. There is also the option of using the PCB in a Kinesis Professional (with the flex PCB "fingers") by using Molex 39-53-2134 on J2 and J7.  For Kinesis Advantage a Molex 39-53-2135 or Cvilux CF01-13-1V00 is used on J2 and J7.
